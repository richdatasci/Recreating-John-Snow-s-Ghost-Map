Some even say one of the greatest physicians of all time.</p>\n","<p>As a leading advocate of both anesthesia and hygienic practices in medicine, he not only experimented with ether and chloroform but also designed a mask and method how to administer it. He personally administered chloroform to Queen Victoria during the births of her eighth and ninth children, in 1853 and 1857, which assured a growing public acceptance of the use of anesthetics during childbirth.</p>\n","<p>But, as we will show later, not all his life was just a success. John Snow is now also recognized as one of the founders of modern epidemiology <em>(some also consider him as the founder of data visualization, spatial analysis, data science in general, and many other related fields)</em> for his scientific and pretty modern data approach in identifying the source of a cholera outbreak in Soho, London in 1854, but it wasn't always like this. In fact, for a long time, he was simply ignored by the scientific community and currently is very often mythified. </p>\n","<p>In this notebook, we're not only going to rediscover his \"data story\", but reanalyze the data that he collected in 1854 and recreate his famous map (also called The Ghost Map).</p>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":0,"metadata":{"dc":{"key":"4"},"tags":["sample_code"]},"outputs":[],"source":["# Loading in the pandas module\n","# ...

Originally he formulated and published his theory that cholera is spread by water or food  in an essay On the Mode of Communication of Cholera (before the outbreak in 1849). The essay received negative reviews in the Lancet and the London Medical Gazette. </p>\n","<p>We know now that he was right, but Dr. Snow's dilemma was how to prove it?
